//! [Church encoding] of data types, data structures and operations.
//!
//! This module defines Church encoded data types like boolean or numerals and
//! data structures like pair and list as well as operations with that data.
//!
//! The data types and data structures defined in this module are also
//! predefined named constants in the default environment which can be created
//! by calling `Environment::default()`.
