//! The inspection mechanism for tracing and interrupting reduction and
//! evaluation functions.
//!
//! The inspection mechanism allows to trace the steps of reduction and
//! evaluation functions and to stop reduction or evaluation depending on some
//! condition.
//!
//! The central piece of the inspection mechanism is the
//! [`Inspect`](trait.Inspect.html) trait. The `reduce_inspected` and
//! `evaluate_inspected` functions take an implementation of the `Inspect` trait
//! to extend the processing with some additional functionality. An
//! implementation of the `Inspect` trait is called an inspection.
//!
//! This module provides some implementation of the `Inspect` trait:
//!
//! * [Limit](struct.Limit.html) : Limits the number of steps executed during
//!   evaluation or reduction.
//! * [Trace](struct.Limit.html) : Allows to log or print the results of each
//!   step during evaluation or reduction.
//! * [Collect](struct.Collect.html) : Collects clones of the term resulting
//!   from each single step during evaluation or reduction.
//!
//! Inspections can be combined using the combinator inspections:
//!
//! * [And](struct.And.html) : Combines two inspections into one inspection that
//!   stops processing if both inspections return `Stop::Yes`.
//! * [Or](struct.Or.html) : Combines two inspections into one inspection that
//!   stops processing if one of them returns `Stop::Yes`.
//!
//! To construct the combinator inspections in a more concise syntax the
//! functions [`and`](fn.and.html) and [`or`](fn.or.html) are provided.
