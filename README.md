[lamcal] is a [Lambda Calculus] parser and evaluator written in [Rust] and a separate command line
REPL application to play around with lambda expressions interactively.
 
Highlights:

* Implementation of the pure untyped lambda calculus
* Support for arbitrary huge terms by using trampolining instead of recursion in all functions
* Feature rich [command line REPL application]((https://github.com/haraldmaida/lamcal/tree/master/repl))
  ([separate crate](https://crates.io/crates/lamcal-repl))
 
The library can be used to
    
* parse lambda expressions in classic notation into terms, like `parse_str("(λx.(λy.x y) a) b")`
  <br /> or `parse_str("(\\x.(\\y.x y) a) b")`
* construct terms programmatically using functions, e.g. `lam("x", app(var("x"), var("y")))`
* construct a sequence of function applications using the macro `app!`, e.g.
  `app![var("a"), var("b"), var("c")]` which is equivalent to 
  `app(app(var("a"), var("b")), var("c))`
* evaluate lambda terms to replace variables with predefined terms bound to the variable's name in
  the environment  
* apply α-conversion to terms using different strategies, such as enumeration or appending the tick
  symbol
* apply β-reduction to terms using different strategies, such as call-by-name, normal-order or 
  call-by-value
* be extended by implementing user specific strategies for α-conversion and β-reduction.

The separate crate [lamcal-repl] 
([crate](https://crates.io/crates/lamcal-repl), 
 [github-repository](https://github.com/haraldmaida/lamcal/tree/master/repl)
)
provides the command line REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) application to play around with lambda 
calculus terms and applying α-conversion and β-reduction interactively.

Features:

* Evaluation functions are provided in two variants: An associated function, e.g. `Term::reduce`,
  that mutates the term in place and a standalone function, e.g. `reduce`, that leaves the original
  term unchanged and returns the result as a new term.
* Strategies for α-conversion and β-reduction are defined as traits to easily implement custom
  strategies and use it with the functionality of this library.
* No recursion in any of the functions dealing with the recursive data structure of `Term` to avoid
  stack overflow errors when applied on huge terms. Instead all functions follow the trampolining
  pattern.
* The parser gives detailed information about parse errors, like the position of the error in the 
  source stream and what would have been expected instead in a valid expression.
* Optional support for [`failure`] crate compatible error types.  

## Usage

To use [lamcal] as a library in your project add this to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
lamcal = "0.3"
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate lamcal;
```

For details about the library see the [documentation] at crates.io.

This library optionally supports the [`failure`] crate. The support for the `failure` crate is a crate
feature. To enable it add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
lamcal = { version = "0.3", features = ["failure"] }
```
